# Hi there! #

My name is Demonitized and I like to code stuff. I am currently in High School and mainly work on DEMONITIZED BOT which is my custom bot for Twitch and Discord!

I like to watch Star Trek and Sci-Fi shows as I am a **HUGE** space nerd.

I will sometimes upload to this repo, however most of the files in this repo will be used for other projects I have. I may upload some JavaScript files, fonts, stylesheets, and other things that I want to find easially.

I am also a pretty active user in [Quimbly3](https://twitch.tv/quimbly3), [PastelsDarling](https://twitch.tv/pastelsdarling), and [Hen_zoid](https://twitch.tv/hen_zoid)'s chats, so you can find me there most likely.

Pronouns: he/they (any will work)

Currently Learning: Java, C++, and C#

Thanks for reading!
